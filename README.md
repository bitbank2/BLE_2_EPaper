**This collection of code is a place to experiment with sending images from one system to another over BLE and displaying them on e-paper. The ultimate use will be to have low power MCUs listening for connections and efficiently receiving images wirelessly either from computers or other MCUs. For now I have an Arduino Nano 33 BLE receiver with the e-paper attached as well as hacked Hanshow electronic shelf labels. On the sending side I have a MacOS GUI application with drag-drop image handling and a slightly less functional Android app which can also send images. Feel free to contribute code or ideas to improve any or all of this project**<br>
